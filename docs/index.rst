Welcome to Cuvis AI's documentation!
=====================================

This is the documentation for the Cuvis AI framework.

Introduction
------------

The goal of cuvis ai is to provide a uniform and easy to use interface
to allow users to quickly start creating their own ai applications.

cuvis ai does not re-invent the wheel, instead it tries to get as much functionality as possible
from already existing frameworks like PyTorch_, sklearn_ and others.
